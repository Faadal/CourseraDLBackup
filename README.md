# CourseraDLBackup
Just a *tiny* library to download the Coursera Deep Learning Homework.

So, just upload CourseraDL.ipynb and courseradl.py to the notebook server.

1. First get to a programming assignment page. (It doesn't matter which, but the root directory will be for _that_ course. (As in course 1 of the DL specialization will have to be done separately from course 2, etc.) ![Navigate the the programming assignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnsh/CourseraDLBackup/master/help/help1.png)
2.  Click File|Open. ![Click File|Open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnsh/CourseraDLBackup/master/help/help2.png)
